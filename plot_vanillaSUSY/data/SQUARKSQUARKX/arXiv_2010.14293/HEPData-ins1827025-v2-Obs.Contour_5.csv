#: description: Exclusion limits for squark pair production with a one-step decay via an intermediate chargino. The neutralino mass is fixed at 60 GeV and exclusion limits are given for mass difference ratio, $X$, as a function of the squark mass. Exclusion limits are obtained by using the signal region with the best expected sensitivity at each point. The observed limits are indicated by the medium dark (maroon) curves where the solid contour represents the nominal limit, and the dotted lines are obtained by varying the signal cross-section by the renormalisation and factorisation scale and PDF uncertainties.
